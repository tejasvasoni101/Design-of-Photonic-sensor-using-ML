# Design-of-Photonic-sensor-using-ML


Optimal meta-surface structures like of gratings and study their transmission and reflection spectra
using generated using MATLAB package GRATOR(grating simulator), further apply machine learning techniques on the
generated data to find optimal structures which can be used for efficient implementation as bio-sensors.
